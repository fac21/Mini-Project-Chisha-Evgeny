## Speech to Text Recognition 
We looked through the WesBos Challenges and decided to go with the Speech Recognition project. We decided on this because we wanted to create something with more emphasis on accessibility and make the app more useful for people in everyday life

## Plan and Action 
 - Followed the Kanban Board
 - Created some User Stories and Issues
 - Try and implement some of the things we have already learnt
 - Included a Stretch - Testing our code
